# Bulldog Kernel – Syscall Development Guide

**Version:** v0.1-pre  
**Updated:** 2025-11-30  

This document replaces the former `apic.md` milestone guide.  
It provides technical context for contributors working on privilege switching and syscall infrastructure in the `feature/syscall` branch.

---

## Milestone Lineage

- `feature/pic8259` → Legacy PIC baseline  
- `feature/apic` → Modern APIC baseline  
- `feature/syscall` → Privilege switching + syscall interface  

---

## Purpose

The `feature/syscall` branch builds on the APIC baseline and introduces:

- Ring 0 ↔ Ring 3 privilege switching  
- Syscall table and dispatcher  
- Example syscalls for user ↔ kernel transitions  
- Contributor visibility through logging and test harnesses  

---

## Privilege Switching

### Goals

- Enable execution of user‑mode code (Ring 3) while maintaining kernel‑mode (Ring 0) isolation.  
- Provide safe transitions between privilege levels using interrupts, exceptions, and syscalls.  

### Implementation Steps

1. **GDT/TSS Setup**  
   - Define separate segments for Ring 0 and Ring 3.  
   - Configure Task State Segment (TSS) with kernel stack pointers.  

2. **Stack Switching**  
   - On privilege transitions, CPU loads the kernel stack from TSS.  
   - Validate stack alignment for interrupt handling.  

3. **Interrupt Handling**  
   - Ensure IDT entries for syscalls and exceptions are configured with correct privilege levels.  
   - Mask or unmask vectors as needed.  

---

## Syscall Model Overview

Bulldog’s syscall design is secure, scalable, and contributor‑friendly.  
Applications never call raw interrupts or numeric IDs directly. Instead, they use a wrapper library that exposes clean, named functions such as `open_file()` or `spawn_process()`.

### Lifecycle

1. **Wrapper Library (User Space)**  
   - Validates arguments, attaches capability token, logs metadata.  

2. **Dispatcher (Kernel Boundary)**  
   - Receives request, verifies token, checks syscall table integrity, queues request.  

3. **Worker Pool (Kernel Space)**  
   - Executes handler under strict security policies and returns result.  

4. **Response Path**  
   - Dispatcher sends result back, wrapper logs completion, application continues.  

### Benefits

- **Security:** Capability tokens prevent arbitrary syscall abuse.  
- **Auditability:** Logging at both wrapper and dispatcher levels creates a clear trail.  
- **Scalability:** Worker pool avoids one‑to‑one thread pairing overhead.  
- **Contributor Hygiene:** Developers see a simple API while the kernel enforces strict contracts.

## Syscall Infrastructure

### Dispatcher

- A central syscall handler receives requests from user mode.  
- Syscall number indexes into a syscall table.  

### Syscall Table

- Array of function pointers or a Rust `match` statement.  
- Example entries:  
  - `0x01` → framebuffer write  
  - `0x02` → process yield  
  - `0x03` → get system time  

### Example Stub

```rust
pub fn syscall_dispatch(num: u64, arg1: u64, arg2: u64) -> u64 {
    match num {
        0x01 => framebuffer_write(arg1 as *const u8, arg2 as usize),
        0x02 => process_yield(),
        0x03 => system_time(),
        _    => error_unknown_syscall(num),
    }
}
```

## Calling Convention

- **rax** → syscall number  
- **rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, r9** → arguments (up to 6)  
- **rax** → return value  
- Preserve: `rbp`, `rbx`, `r12–r15` (callee‑saved)  
- Errors returned via `rax` using negative codes  

---

## Contributor Tasks & Hygiene

- Implement privilege switching logic in `arch/x86_64/syscall.rs`.  
- Add at least one working syscall (e.g., framebuffer write).  
- Extend logging to show syscall invocations.  
- Document unsafe blocks with justification.  
- Update `docs/syscall.md` whenever a new syscall is added.  
- Test under QEMU before submitting PRs.  
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive.  
- Justify all `unsafe` blocks with comments explaining invariants.  
- Align contributions with roadmap milestones.  
- Maintain branch hygiene (tags, clean forks from APIC baseline).
